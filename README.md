# Canvas-Sun
When I was younger I was trying to imagine exactly how distance from the sun affected the concentration of light rays. I started drawing it in 2D on paper and came up with basically the pattern in this project, but didn't have the patience to draw hundreds of perfect straight lines to complete the image. Thought of this again randomly and realized I could translate it into html canvas. 

This project convinced me that html canvas is perhaps the most fun use of trigonometry possible, and should be introduced to every highschool curriculumn.
